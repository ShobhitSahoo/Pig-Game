                1. Welcome to the Pig Game!! The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.<br>
                2. In each round, a player rolls the dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to his/her <strong>CURRENT ROUND SCORE</strong>.<br>
                3. But, if the player rolls 1 then his/her current round score is lost. It sets back to 0. After that it's the other player's turn.<br>
                4. The player can choose to <strong>HOLD</strong>, which means that his/her current round score gets added to his/her <strong>OVERALL SCORE</strong>. After that it's the next player's turn.<br>
                5. The first player to reach the winning score/final score wins. Winning score is the score that you set before game starts or else it's set to default value that is 100.<br>
                6. Last but not least, <strong>the player will lose his/her entire score i.e., overall score</strong> if you roll two sixes in a row. So don't forget to hold.<br><br>
                <center><strong>Now enjoy the game</strong></center>
